      <h1>Jake Evans</h1>
      <p>I’m Jake Evans. I live, work, and raise my family in Neosho, and this site exists to share information, context, and thoughtful perspective on issues that affect our community.</p>

      <p>By profession, I’m a business process analyst with more than a decade of experience working in operations, data analysis, and accountability-driven decision-making. My work centers on asking practical questions: <em>How does this actually work? Why does it exist this way? And is it serving people the way it should?</em></p>

      <p>I’m also a U.S. Army veteran, where I learned the value of preparation, clear communication, and knowing when to slow things down so better decisions can be made.</p>

      <p>Locally, I stay involved by attending public meetings, reviewing agendas and packets, reading ordinances and city code, and paying attention to how decisions move from discussion to implementation.</p>

      <p>This site is not affiliated with the City of Neosho or any government office. The views expressed here are my own. My goal isn’t to persuade, inflame, or posture—it’s to inform, reflect, and document.</p>

      <p>Above all, I believe communities are strongest when citizens are informed, curious, and willing to engage with facts—even when the answers aren’t simple.</p>
